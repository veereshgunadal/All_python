1. f.read()
   size - optional numeric argument
   reads the file.
   returns as string(for txt) or as bytes object(binary mode)

2. f.readline()
   reads the single line of file. may be read upto \n
                                  and after reading upto \n, may be considers \n as line(not sure)

   try both check output
   put for line in f:
       print(line)

   put for line in f:
       print(line , end='')

3. f.readlines() and list(f)
   reads and gives list of lines

4. f.write("nniodms")
   writes string to the file
   other types of objects to be converted to string or binay mode to write in file

5. f.tell()
   returns an integer giving the file objectâ€™s current position in the 
   file represented as number of bytes from the beginning of the file 
   when in binary mode and an opaque number when in text mode

6. f.seek(offset, whence)
   
   whence default is 0. whence is reference position
                     0 - begining position
                     1 - current position
                     2 - end postion
   
   offset - numeric value

   seek is computed by whence(reference postion) + offset
   
   but for text mode, seek is allowed for begining of the file always.
